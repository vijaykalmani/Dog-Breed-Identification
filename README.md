# Dog-Breed-Identification
## Tasks to be performed:
Stanford Vision department, has collected and annotated images of 120 breeds of dogs from ImageNet. Dataset can be found here. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification
- Prepare an EDA sheet & explain what you understand from this data. What would be your approach? 
- With a limited number of training images per class, what extra steps will you incorporate for a good model? 
- Iterate over and try different architecture and topologies and preserve the results of each experiment using TensorBoard. Also, save major metrics in an Excel (or try W&B).
