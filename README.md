# Dog-Breed-Identification
Tasks to be performed:
#### 1.	Briefly describe the disadvantages of Flattening (as first layer or after Input) and how do you overcome those issues ?
#### 2.	Stanford Vision department, has collected and annotated images of 120 breeds of dogs from ImageNet. Dataset can be found here. https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification
- Prepare an EDA sheet & explain what you understand from this data. What would be your approach? 
- With a limited number of training images per class, what extra steps will you incorporate for a good model? 
- Iterate over and try different architecture and topologies and preserve the results of each experiment using TensorBoard. Also, save major metrics in an Excel (or try W&B). 

#### 3.	 Achieve the above problem on Kaggle itself and submit your results.
#### 4.	What are Convolutional Neural Networks and how are they better than regular only Fully Connected Neural Networks? 
#### 5.	The major components of a CNN topology are Filter/ Kernel, Strides, etc. Explain mathematically the output of a single CNN layer and how it is impacted by strides? 
#### 6.	For a single channel image, size (9x9) and a filter of size (2x2) and stride (2x2), calculate the output. Is padding required ? What is the output size of this convoluted feature? 
#### 7.	For a particular problem if the error is not dipping below a standard point, what are the techniques used to reduce error ? Explain the methodology in depth and with examples.
